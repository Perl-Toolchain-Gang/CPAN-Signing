## 2023-05-02 Meeting Notes

A few people from CPAN and TUF met to discuss how TUF might help CPAN to sign
our distributions.

TODO: Add acutal meeting notes here but leave out people's names until they
agree to be cited by name.

Goal: Figuring out if TUF is a good fit for CPAN author and repo signing

Points:
- TUF has been around since 2010, probably a good use case for CPAN
- TUF supports repo and author signing
- Look at python reference implementation first, has had most work
- Can start with repo signing, then add author signing
- Client does not need to be updated to support author signing later
- Needs only ed25519 + sha256 primitives for implementation
- Supports transparency log type features via snapshot
- Supports hardware keys, root keys sometimes use YubiHSM
- Should implement client first
- Supports multiple 
- Could propose to add client to cpan, cpanm, cpanp and cpm
- Might need Ed25519 distribution in core for a perl implementation
